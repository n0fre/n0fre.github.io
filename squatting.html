        <h1 class="essay">Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Squatting Rights</h1>
<h2 class="essay">Introduction</h2>
<p>Squatting refers to the occupation of unused or derelict buildings or land without the permission of the owner. Through a process known as <i>adverse possession</i>, squatters attempt to gain legal title to a piece of property. {!Pruijt outlines five basic reasons why people squat: (i) out of deprivation...}[Pruijt, Hans. “Squatting in Europe.” <i>Social Movement Studies</i> 12.1 (2013): 1–17. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.732674">10.1080/14742837.2012.732674</a>.] {!United Nations estimates are that 800 to 900 million people worldwide are technically squatters}[UN-Habitat. “Streets as Tools for Urban Transformation in Slums.” 2013.] Despite this, the subject is rarely discussed in political or academic debates.</p>

<p>In the contractualist approach as outlined in his <i>The Social Contract</i>, {!Rousseau discusses his social contract theory as a social pact...}[Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. <i>The Social Contract</i>. Trans. Christopher Betts. Oxford University Press, 1994.] I do not interpret the general will here in its direct democratic interpretation... but an embodiment of the citizens' common interests that are approximated through legislations in a representative democracy.</p>

<p>In this essay, I will defend the view that squatting is justified through the social contract theory as outlined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. First, I will argue that squatters, rather than owners of unused property, have a right of first occupancy. Second, I will argue that any legal title pertaining to unused property is illegitimate due to it not being in favour of the general will. Third, I will argue that squatting is justified because it is a form of direct action against a violation of the social contract. Lastly, I will anticipate certain objections to my thesis...</p>

<h2 class="essay">Main body</h2>

<h3 class="essay">Argument 1: squatters have the right of first occupancy</h3>
<p>In book 1, chapter 9 of <i>The Social Contract</i>, {!Rousseau sets out to answer how a claim on private property can be justified...}[Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. <i>The Social Contract</i>. 1994.] According to Rousseau, a claim on private property can be justified by legal title and by the <i>right of first occupancy</i>, the latter of which must meet three conditions:
<ul>
<li>The land must not be inhabited by someone else.</li>
<li>No more must be occupied than is needed for subsistence.</li>
<li>Possession must be taken not by empty ceremonies, but by work and cultivation.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>Rousseau does not explain in this chapter what he explicitly means by legal title, but he does emphasize his argument... ‘the right that each individual has over his property is always subordinate to the right that the community has over everyone’ (p.62).</p>
<p>The doctrine of adverse possession exists to encourage and reward productive uses of space by countering needless vacancy... {!Examples: No Borders Kitchen Lesvos, Nottingham Squatting Project, Amsterdam cultural squats}[No Borders Kitchen, 2017; Lodge, 2005; Dee, E.T.C., 2015.]</p>

<h3 class="essay">Argument 2: legal title to unused property is illegitimate</h3>
<p>The remaining justification that owners... would be their legal title to the property. Rousseau held the belief that the general will... If the general will is in favour of squatting without legislature following suit, then the current property laws in that state have little to no claim to legitimacy.</p>

<p>{!Rawls’ veil of ignorance is used to elaborate...}[Rawls, John. <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Harvard University Press, 1971.] From the perspective of the original position, a rational choice can be made... the private will of a squatter is not in conflict with his general will as a citizen, but the private will of an owner... is.</p>

<h3 class="essay">Argument 3: squatting is direct action against a violation of the social contract</h3>
<p>In <i>The Social Contract</i>, {!Rousseau argues that in a primitive state of nature people have an unlimited right to everything...}[Rousseau, Jean-Jacques. <i>The Social Contract</i>. 1994, p.269.] It follows that when people give up their natural freedom for civil freedom, civil rights are owed to them... Squatting can be framed as direct action against the state for violating the social contract by failing to provide available and affordable housing for its citizens.</p>

<h3 class="essay">Counterargument 1: anti-squat measures provide a viable alternative</h3>
<p>Anti-squat is the inhabiting of unused real estate by a small group of people to guard the property from adverse possession... However, these anti-squatting measures do not allow the temporary tenant to make any changes to the property... It is an empty ceremony.</p>

<h3 class="essay">Counterargument 2: in certain cases, the general will is not in favour of squatting</h3>
<p>It can be objected that... the general will is not in favour of squatting rights... {!Dee writes that the 2010 ban on squatting rights in the Netherlands cannot be traced to one single factor...}[Dee, E.T.C. “The Dutch Squatting Ban.” <i>Urban Studies</i> 53.13 (2016): 2739–2754. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098015608567">10.1177/0042098015608567</a>.]</p>
<p>However, Rousseau anticipated that in any republic, the corporate will of a subset of the sovereign... {!Dee explains the shift in the majority perception of squatting as a “moral panic”...}[ibid.]</p>

<h2 class="essay">Conclusion</h2>
<p>As I have shown using three arguments, squatting is justified through the social contract theory as outlined by Jean-Jacques Rousseau. First, squatters have the right of first occupancy... Second, the legal title... is illegitimate... Third, squatting is a form of direct action... Lastly, I have anticipated certain objections... anti-squatting is not a viable alternative... and the general will behind the 2010 Dutch squatting ban may have been a substitution of a corporate will.</p>
