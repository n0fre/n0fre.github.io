        <h1 class="essay">Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Squatting Rights</h1>
        <h2 class="essay">Introduction</h2>
        <p>Squatting refers to the occupation of unused or derelict buildings or land without the permission of the
          owner. Through a process known as <i>adverse possession</i>, squatters attempt to gain legal title to a piece
          of property. {!Pruijt outlines five basic reasons why people squat...}[Hans Pruijt. ‘Squatting in Europe’. In:
          <i>Social Movement Studies</i> 12.1 (2013), pp. 1–17. doi: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1080/14742837.2012.732674">10.1080/14742837.2012.732674</a>.] {!United Nations
          estimates...}[UN-Habitat. <i>Streets as Tools for Urban Transformation in Slums</i>. 2013.] Despite this, the
          subject is rarely discussed in political or academic debates.</p>
        <p>In the contractualist approach as outlined in his <i>The Social Contract</i>, {!Rousseau discusses his social
          contract theory...}[Jean-Jacques Rousseau. <i>The Social Contract</i>. Trans. by Christopher Betts. Oxford
          University Press, 1994.] Using this theory, the legitimacy of laws and authority can be evaluated based on how
          well it is guided by the <i>general will</i> of the members of the state. I do not interpret the general will
          here in its direct democratic interpretation, but as an embodiment of the citizens’ common interests
          approximated through representative democracy.</p>
        <p>In this essay, I will defend the view that squatting is justified through the social contract theory as
          outlined by Rousseau. First, I will argue that squatters have a right of first occupancy. Second, I will argue
          that legal title to unused property is illegitimate if not in favour of the general will. Third, I will argue
          that squatting is justified as direct action against a violation of the social contract. Lastly, I will
          respond to objections, namely that anti-squat measures provide an alternative and that the general will may
          not favour squatting in all contexts.</p>

        <h2 class="essay">Main body</h2>

        <h3 class="essay">Argument 1: squatters have the right of first occupancy</h3>
        <p>{!In book 1, chapter 9 of <i>The Social Contract</i>...}[Rousseau, <i>The Social Contract</i>, 1994.]
          According to Rousseau, property can be justified by legal title or by the <i>right of first occupancy</i>,
          which requires that:
        <ul>
          <li>The land is uninhabited</li>
          <li>Only what is needed is occupied</li>
          <li>Possession is taken by work, not ceremony</li>
        </ul>
        Squatters often meet these conditions while owners of unused property do not.</p>
        <p>{!Examples of squats include...}[No Borders Kitchen Lesvos, 2017. Nottingham Squatting Project. Lodge, 2005.
          Dee, E.T.C. ‘The Right to Squat’ (2015).]</p>

        <h3 class="essay">Argument 2: legal title to unused property is illegitimate</h3>
        <p>Legal title derives legitimacy only if aligned with the general will. In representative democracies, this
          link is weaker. If the general will supports squatting, then laws against it lack legitimacy.</p>
        <p>{!This function of the general will parallels...}[John Rawls. <i>A Theory of Justice</i>. Harvard University
          Press, 1971.] Under a veil of ignorance, rational actors would prefer a society where squatting is legal, as
          the worst-off (homeless) are better protected. Hence, the general will supports squatting rights more than
          owners’ claims to unused real estate.</p>

        <h3 class="essay">Argument 3: squatting is direct action against a violation of the social contract</h3>
        <p>{!In <i>The Social Contract</i>, Rousseau argues that...}[Rousseau, <i>The Social Contract</i>, 1994, p.269.]
          Citizens give up natural freedom for civil freedom. Housing is part of civil rights. Squatting is a form of
          resistance when the state fails to provide housing or others hoard it in violation of social cooperation.
          Thus, it is justified by the very principles of the contract.</p>

        <h3 class="essay">Counterargument 1: anti-squat measures provide a viable alternative</h3>
        <p>Anti-squat policies involve placing temporary tenants in unused spaces. However, these tenants lack rights
          and cannot improve the property. This is an “empty ceremony” and fails to fulfil the spirit of first
          occupancy. Thus, it is not a viable ethical or philosophical alternative to squatting.</p>

        <h3 class="essay">Counterargument 2: in certain cases, the general will is not in favour of squatting</h3>
        <p>In the Netherlands, squatting was criminalized in 2010. {!Dee explains that...}[E.T.C. Dee. ‘The Dutch
          Squatting Ban’. In: <i>Urban Studies</i> 53.13 (2016), pp. 2739–2754. doi: <a
            href="https://doi.org/10.1177/0042098015608567">10.1177/0042098015608567</a>.] This shift resulted from a
          coalition of right-leaning politicians and property owners, not a true reflection of general will. Rousseau
          warned that the corporate will can masquerade as the general will, leading to illegitimate legislation.</p>

        <h2 class="essay">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Squatting is justified under Rousseau’s theory of the social contract. Squatters meet the criteria of first
          occupancy; property title without public benefit lacks legitimacy; and squatting can be a necessary form of
          civil action. Objections — such as anti-squat alternatives or shifts in public opinion — fail to refute this
          justification when the general will is properly understood.</p>
