        <h2 class="essay">Introduction</h2>
        <h3 class="essay">Patient-reported outcomes and phenomenology</h3>
        <p>In medical research, outcomes are used to assess the effect of a medical or pharmaceutical intervention. The outcome that is measured in the control group, which is given a placebo, acts as the baseline to compare the outcome that is measured in the intervention group with. Furthermore, these outcomes are important for health economists who seek to quantify certain states of disease to use in cost-utility analyses. Health outcomes can be expressed quantitatively, examples include lung capacity, number of exacerbations or days spent in the hospital. Health outcomes can also be expressed qualitatively. These are known as patient-reported outcomes (PROs) and encompass domains such as social functioning, bodily pain and general and mental health. Validated questionnaires, such as the SF-36, EQ-5D or EXACT-PRO, are instruments generally used to collect PROs with. Next to questionnaires, preference-based methods such as ‘time trade-off’ or ‘standard gamble’ are used.</p>
        <p>In order to be validated by relevant regulatory authorities, PRO instruments must be developed according to a sound conceptual framework. Relevant determinants to guide a PRO conceptual framework are the rationale of the choice of outcomes (e.g., health-related quality of life, physical function) in specific populations (e.g., patients undergoing a certain treatment) for a particular decision to be made (e.g., choice of treatment). In the development of such PRO concepts, the patient is asked to provide a summary of the illness experience, the treatment effect, the interaction with the health care environment, and to illustrate the functional implications of the illness. It must be recognized that these assessments are modulated by the expectations, intrinsic values and internal standards of the patient. In discussing the conceptual issues of PRO development, {!Rothman et al.}[Margaret L. Rothman et al. ‘Patient-reported outcomes: Conceptual issues’. In: <cite>Value in Health</cite> 10.SUPPL. 2 (2007), S66–S75. issn: 15244733. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00269.x">10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00269.x</a>.]    conclude that there is a wide gap between the endeavour to capture the patient’s perspective and the reality of PRO instrument; they frequently reflect a professional judgement orientation on what is important to the patient with fewer regard for what the patient actually experiences.</p>
        <p>In order to address this gap, {!phenomenology has been proposed to guide PRO instrument development.}[Havi Carel. ‘Phenomenology and its application in medicine’. In: <cite>Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics</cite> 32.1 (2011), pp. 33–46. issn: 13867415. doi:<a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11017-010-9161-x">10.1007/s11017-010-9161-x</a>, p.41.] Phenomenologists try to deduce the common essential properties of lived experience from the direct intuitive experience of phenomena. Focus group discussions with a small sample of people who have experienced the phenomenon in question are usually sufficient to distill a phenomenological account from. This approach was used in the development of the {!EXACT-PRO questionnaire,}[Nancy Kline Leidy et al. ‘Development of the EXAcerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease tool (EXACT): A patient-reported outcome (PRO) measure’. In: <cite>Value in Health</cite> 13.8 (2010), pp. 965–975. issn: 15244733. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00772.x">10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00772.x</a>.] in which 40 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were interviewed in order to collect qualitative data from. {!The phenomenological approach is different than other methods that can be used in qualitative health research, such as discourse analysis or grounded theory.}[Helene Starks and Susan Brown Trinidad. ‘Choose your method: A comparison of phenomenology, discourse analysis, and grounded theory’. In: <cite>Qualitative Health Research</cite> 17.10 (2007), pp. 1372–1380. issn: 10497323. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1177/1049732307307031">10.1177/1049732307307031</a>.]</p>
        <h3 class="essay">Merleau-Ponty's <i>Phenomenology of Perception</i></h3>
        <p>In his {!<i>Phenomenology of Perception (PP)</i>,}[Maurice Merleau-Ponty. <cite>Phenomenology of Perception</cite>. 1st ed. London: Routledge, Nov. 2011. isbn: 9781135718602. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.4324/9780203720714">10.4324/9780203720714</a>.] Merleau-Ponty provides a rich account of human experience as founded on direct and intuitive perception. He argues that the lived body is ambiguous in that it is both an object and a self-conscious subject. In order to reconcile this, he develops the concept of being-in-the-world, which is an attempt at characterizing the essential way in which the subject is part of a world and not a separate consciousness in opposition to the world. In doing so, he challenges the classic Cartesian mind-body dualism that was prominent in his day. In PP, he begins most chapters by challenging objective thought: the way in which empiricism (or, realism) and intellectualism (or, idealism) posit a ready-made world of objects in which objects are related in a purely external manner.</p>
        <p>Instead, he explores the pre-objective world which scientific discourse presupposes. We have a {!“primordial attachment”}[Ibid., p.341.] to the world, which we inhabit and take part in through the lived body. The body plays such a significant role in this that Merleau-Ponty refers to humans as embodied beings. Furthermore, Merleau-Ponty uses gestalt psychology to develop the concept of the phenomenal field, which is the horizon through which we perceive the world in a figure-background structure. He extends this gestalt view to explore how we experience our phenomenal body as a unity of senses. By applying his phenomenology of embodiment to case studies such as the phantom limb experience or psychic blindness, Merleau-Ponty effectively convinces the reader to question their objective conceptual mode of thinking and adopt the perspective of embodiment.</p>
        <p>In this essay, I will discuss the feasibility of the use of relevant health-related concepts in Merleau-Ponty’s PP in the development of PROs. First, I will discuss the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire for measuring general health-related quality of life and I will link the domains in this questionnaire with Merleau-Pontian concepts. I will then identify in what way those concepts are influenced by illness, and will use this to formulate PROs that could be used in the same way as how the EQ-5D questionnaire is structured. Second, I will address the conceptual issues of translating a phenomenological approach for collecting PROs by discussing another PRO instrument, namely the time trade-off (TTO) method. Then, I will discuss alternative ways of using embodiment for PROs.</p>
        <h2 class="essay">Main body</h2>
        <h3 class="essay">EQ-5D questionnaire</h3>

        </figure>
        <p>The EQ-5D questionnaire is a commonly used PRO instrument to determine quality of life. The standard version of the form assesses quality of life using five questions regarding; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression. Each question can be answered according to a three-level nominal scale ranging from no difficulty to extreme difficulty. The EQ-5D questionnaire is complemented by a thermometer-like scale ranging from 0 to 100, with 0 indicating the worst possible health state and 100 indicating the best imaginable health state (see Figure 1). The EQ-5D questionnaire is able to capture 243 (=3<sup>5</sup>) theoretical health states and has been translated and culturally adapted to target countries using population-specific preference weights. The descriptive system was agreed upon by a thorough review of the health-related quality of life literature. {!The EuroQol group has consciously opted to trade multidimensionality for simplicity.}[R. Rabin and F. De Charro. ‘EQ-5D: A measure of health status from the EuroQol Group’. In: <cite>Annals of Medicine</cite> 33.5 (2001), pp. 337–343. issn: 07853890. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.3109/07853890109002087">10.3109/07853890109002087</a>.] The EQ-5D instrument has appeared in more than 1,000 peer-reviewed articles since its inception and has been widely used for cost-utility analyses of health care interventions.</p>
        <p>The first three domains of the questionnaire are referred to as the ‘functional domains’ and are regarded as being distinct from the latter two domains. This categorization might result from the fact that the ability to walk around, wash oneself or perform activities can be observed, while the experience of pain, discomfort, or anxiety must be communicated by the patient. Upon further observation, it seems that the domains are interrelated: being confined to bed would restrict the ability to wash or dress myself or to perform my usual activities. It would also seem that having extreme pain would hurt my mental health and affect my performance in the other domains. Furthermore, we can see that the descriptions of the domains of the EQ-5D do not fully capture the experiences that they seek to describe. The experience of mobility cannot be reduced to either walking about or being confined to bed. Likewise, the performance of usual activities seems to also encompass actions related to self-care.</p>
        <p>In order to illustrate how Merleau-Ponty’s embodied phenomenology can aid in addressing these ambiguities, let us link the domains of the EQ-5D questionnaire with his concepts. Furthermore, I will propose examples of PROs related to these concepts and domains that are guided by embodiment.</p>
        <h4 class="essay">Motricity and intentionality</h4>
        <p>In <i>PP</i>, Merleau-Ponty uses the term ‘motricity’ [<i>motricité</i>] to refer to mobility and relates this to the spatiality of the body. In short, we constantly have a pre-reflective awareness of the location of our limbs through what Merleau-Ponty calls the body schema, and the awareness of our bodies is inextricably linked to our world of perception. He illustrates the concept of motor intentionality, {!in which he extends the notion of intentionality to the body schema.}[Intentionality refers to the power to form representations. You cannot just have thoughts, your thoughts are always about something. Philosophers before Merleau-Ponty originally attributed intentionality only to mental phenomena.] My body is situated in the world and intends itself towards things; my hands animate a field of objects that appear manipulable in themselves. My body is {!“towards the things.”}[Merleau-Ponty, <i>Phenomenology of Perception</i>, p.140.] This implies that the body is ahead of thought. More strongly, the body includes consciousness and signifies its surroundings. This way, consciousness is not an “I think that,” but rather an {!“I can.”}[Ibid., p.139.]</p>
        <p>When mobility is seen from this perspective of the lived body, it becomes easier to imagine how this can be impacted by illness. A healthy person experiences mobility as something that appears to be very straightforward. When a healthy person gets out of bed in the morning and wants to drink a glass of water, it seems as if this experience becomes transparent as the body intends itself towards the bathroom sink. Other actions, such as washing oneself with a bar of soap or getting dressed, are carried out in the most economic way possible without interference or preparatory thoughts. On the contrary, such actions have much gravity in the sick patient. Imagine yourself laying in bed with a heavy fever and wanting to get a glass of water: you posit the movement required for getting out of bed, then you verbalize it, you reposition your body with great difficulty in such a way and eventually execute the movement of getting out of bed. The unhealthy person lacks the genuine intentionality required to be towards the bathroom. These differences could be expressed as descriptive PROs such as: ‘Moving in and interacting with my environment feels natural to me,’ or ‘Moving in and interacting with my environment requires a conscious effort.’</p>
        <h4 class="essay">Lived space, the habitual body and habits</h4>
        <p>Merleau-Ponty emphasizes that we as embodied beings are embedded in both space and time, we are {!“of space and of time.”}[Ibid., p.141.] As a result, we can say that we do not inhabit space, but we become space and the space becomes us. For Merleau-Ponty, space is existential, lived and affects the way we feel. Lived space is the both pre-subjective and pre-objective meaningful structure that actualizes my relations to the things; a lived distance links me to things that exist and concern me. This felt space is experienced in terms of peaceful or crowded, familiar or foreign, secure or strange, et cetera. During illness, the experience of lived space changes. {!In a phenomenological analysis of patients’ lived space,}[Annelise Norlyk, Bente Martinsen, and Karin Dahlberg. ‘Getting to Know Patients’ Lived Space’. In: <cite>Indo-Pacific Journal of Phenomenology</cite> 13.2 (Oct. 2013), pp. 1–12. issn: 2079-7222. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.2989/IPJP.2013.13.2.5.1179A">10.2989/IPJP.2013.13.2.5.1179A</a>.] it was found that illness constricts lived space in the sense that functional space becomes problematic, or in the case of severe illness, the experience of home as a sanctuary becomes ruled by feelings of burden and responsibility. It was generally found that the process of recovery corresponded with an expansion of lived space in the sense that the outside world seemed less distant and the physical environment appeared to be more adaptable.</p>
        <p>Taking this in consideration, ‘The space that I can interact with feels large,’ or ‘I feel restricted to a small space’ are PROs that could indicate the experience of health-related lived space.</p>
        <p>Merleau-Ponty makes a distinction between the <i>actual</i> and the <i>habitual</i> body. Most of our actions are pre-reflective, which means that we do not experience them consciously and are the product of habit. This is in contrast with those actions that we consider to conduct consciously. Merleau-Ponty incorporates this distinction in the habitual body, which is linked to general and pre-reflective behaviour, and the actual body, which is linked to personal and reflective behaviour. Actions that we routinely and reflectively perform become “sedimented” in the habitual body as habits. In illness however, these actions of habit become more difficult to perform as the nexus between the actual and the habitual body weakens. The EQ-5D questionnaire similarly correlates the loss of the ability to perform habitual tasks, such as self-care, working or studying with ill health. However, the corresponding questions do not emphasize the role of the body in performing these habits. In order to discover the connection between the actual and the habitual body, the following PROs could be queried: ‘I feel like I am my body,’ or ‘My body does not feel like it belongs to me.’</p>
        <h4 class="essay">The intentional arc, pain and depression</h4>
        <p>The last two domains of the EQ-5D questionnaire are related to pain, discomfort, anxiety and depression. The perspective of the lived body is particularly well suited to account for these experiences. Intentionality is part of a broader concept that Merleau-Ponty calls the {!“intentional arc,”}[Merleau-Ponty, <i>Phenomenology of Perception</i>, p.137.] the function of which is to unite motor intentionality with temporality and the human, moral and existential setting. This is what {!“goes limp”}[Ibid., p.137.] in disorder. For example, the depressed person’s lack of genuine intentionality is a result of him not being oriented to his situation, in part due to an uncertainty of what the future brings. The chronic pain patient does not experience her pain as only a physical phenomenon that she has, but rather as something that affects her on an existential level. She articulates the world as a painful world because she is constantly brought back into her painful body. In a healthy person, the intentional arc is tightened and creates a {!“unity of the senses,”}[Ibid., p.137.] a unity of the senses with intelligence, and the unity of sensitivity with motricity. This leads to most actions appearing to be deliberate, embedded within a meaningful structure and appearing as a natural sequel to previous actions. Guided by the concept of the intentional arc, the following PROs can be formulated: ‘My world feels meaningful,’ or ‘My actions do not feel as if they have purpose.’</p>
        <h3 class="essay">Conceptual issues of PROs</h3>
        <p>Even though I have shown that embodiment can be used to guide descriptive PROs, there are many conceptual issues regarding PROs, {!the full discussion of which is out of the scope of this review.}[Leah M. McClimans and John Browne. ‘Choosing a patient-reported outcome measure’. In: <i>Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics</i> 32.1 (2011), pp. 47–60. issn: 13867415. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11017-010-9163-8">10.1007/s11017-010-9163-8</a>.]It might simply be impossible to translate the nature of the body, and relations between consciousness and the body into written words or numbers. I will first discuss the TTO to illustrate why this might be the case. Then, I will discuss alternative ways embodiment might be understood for PROs.</p>
        <h4 class="essay">Time trade-off method</h4>
        <p>The TTO method is one method to be used for quality of life assessments. In a TTO, respondents are being asked to imagine themselves in some kind of imperfect health state for a certain amount of time, after which they die. Respondents are then asked how many years living in full health would be equivalent to this ill state. The difference between these time periods can then be used to compute some utility factor for the ill state. For example, if I would indicate that living 10 years in disease state X would be equivalent to living for 7 years in full health, then my utility factor for disease state X would be 0.7. {!To make such as valuation is indeed a very personal choice, and the interpretation of the disease state and the willingness to give up life years is heavily influenced by demographics, beliefs and self-reported own health.}[Floortje van Nooten et al. ‘What should we know about the person behind a TTO?’ In: <i>European Journal of Health Economics</i> 19.9 (2018), pp. 1207–1211. issn: 16187601. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s10198-018-0975-1">10.1007/s10198-018-0975-1 </a>.]</p>
        <p>However, from an embodied perspective, the conceptual framework through which we see time that such a TTO approach forces upon us is objective thought. This leads us to divide the subject from the world and the subject’s hought as distinct from these two. The perception of time is assumed to be distinct from the world and the observer, and time is {!like a river which flows from the past into the future.}[Merleau-Ponty, <i>Phenomenology of Perception</i>, p.433.] However, this metaphor tacitly presupposes an observer that either stands by the riverbank or is swept along by the current. In both cases there is no observable stream from the future into the past. Instead, time is itself our relationship with the world and flows into being by virtue of us being into the world.</p>
        <p>When I am asked to assess the utility of a certain disease state that I have experienced by way of a TTO approach, such as a fever that I suffered a couple of months ago, I first have to recall this experience and {!“reopen time”}[Ibid., p.428.] and carry myself back to when the fever was part of my field of presence. Then, I am asked to extend this field of presence into a time frame of ten years. In addition, I have to imagine living ten years in a state of full health. This is a fruitless attempt, because I cannot circumscribe such a long time frame, just as I cannot circumscribe my own life. Furthermore, in a severe state of health, there might not even be a present to extrapolate. Temporality might then be experienced as a demanding enduring, a perseverance of the past or an inadequacy of the future. For these reasons, I argue that the TTO method is inadequate or too reductionist for understanding the disease experience from an embodied perspective.</p>
        <h4 class="essay">Understanding the lived experience of the patient</h4>
        <p>It can also be argued that, regardless of which medium of communication there is, it is impossible to fully comprehend another person’s lived experience. Merleau-Ponty argues that, just as we never fully grasp our lived present with {!“apodictic certainty,”}[Ibid., p.362.] we can never fully coincide with someone else’s. However, Merleau-Ponty argues, if your conceptual mode of thinking is objective thought, then the existence of other consciousnesses is utterly inconceivable. This inevitably leads to other patients’ bodies being regarded as objects, which will not bridge the gap between the health professional’s judgement and the patient’s experience. On this view, a phenomenological approach is crucial alongside an approach led by objective thought.</p>
        <p>Even though we cannot fully coincide with others, it it the case that we participate, take part and already find ourselves in a social world. Using language, as one of the cultural objects situated in this field, we can create a common world of meanings and discover how we relate to things in similar, embodied ways. We can therefore use language to develop narrative phenomenological approaches such as interviews, diaries or questionnaires, but we can also find out the patient’s experience that goes beyond verbal accounts. Examples of this include ‘walking with’ exercises, or asking the patient to film their day-to-day activities. This will also help health professionals to better understand embodiment and to facilitate its understanding to their patients.</p>
        <p>In clinical trials in which a therapeutic intervention is tested in a small sample of patients, embodied phenomenology could be used to reveal underlying phenomena that cannot be detected by scientific observation. For example, in order to elaborate on the state of being on an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), an antidepressant medication, {!Teal interviewed four persons,}[Jay Teal. ‘Nothing Personal: An Empirical Phenomenological Study of the Experience of “Being-on-an-SSRI”’. In: <i>Journal of Phenomenological Psychology</i> 40.1 (2009), pp. 19–50. issn: 0047-2662. doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1163/156916209X427972">10.1163/156916209X427972</a>.] two diagnosed with depression, one with anxiety and one with obsessive compulsive disorder. They each gave a phenomenological account of ‘being-on-an-SSRI’ before, during, and after the experience. They described that the SSRIs initially alleviated the suffering they described as the inhospitability of their life-worlds. This gradually became an emotionless acceptance of what the world presented to them. The numbing side-effects became inseparable from the treatment effects.</p>
        <h2 class="essay">Conclusion</h2>
        <p>In this review, I have discussed the use of embodiment as described by Merleau-Ponty in his PP for the development of PROs. First, I have used the concepts of a widely used PRO instrument, the EQ-5D questionnaire to illustrate Merleau-Ponty’s concepts of embodiment and proposed new examples for descriptive PROs with this. Second, I have used embodiment to discuss the conceptual issues related to PROs. I have used embodiment to show that the TTO method is inadequate for valuing health states. Furthermore, I have argued that, although we cannot fully coincide with other persons, embodied phenomenology can be used to detect phenomena that could otherwise not be detected with objective thought.</p>
        <p>To conclude, I recommend that health professionals adopt embodiment as a way to better understand the patient’s lived experience, and that embodied phenomenology will be used to inspire the development of new and innovative PRO instruments.</p>
